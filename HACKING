All you need to know when hacking (modifying) GNU libunistring or when building
it off a git checkout.


Requirements
============

You will need reasonably recent versions of the build tools:

  * A C compiler. Such as GNU GCC.
    + Homepage:
      http://gcc.gnu.org/

  * GNU automake
    + Homepage:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/

  * GNU autoconf
    + Homepage:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/

  * GNU m4
    + Homepage:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/

  * GNU gperf
    + Homepage:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/gperf/

  * Perl
    + Homepage:
      http://www.perl.org/

  * Either an internet connection or a recent copy of GNU gnulib.
    + Homepage:
      http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/

And, of course, the packages listed in the DEPENDENCIES file.


Sources
=======

Most of the sources have their origin in gnulib.


Running the testsuite in valgrind
=================================

To run the test suite with a memory access checker and leak detector such as
valgrind,
  1) configure with the options --disable-shared and CFLAGS="-g",
  2) run "make",
  3) edit tests/Makefile to uncomment the appropriate definition of the CHECKER
     macro,
  4) run "make check".
